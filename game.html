                In the dice game "Sevens, Elevens, and Doubles," if a player rolls a 7, 11, or a double, 
                they choose another player to drink a pre-determined amount of alcohol. The drinker must 
                consume the alcohol before the roller rolls another 7, 11, or double, or they continue to 
                drink until successful. Another player can choose to drink the player's drink to avoid the penalty.
